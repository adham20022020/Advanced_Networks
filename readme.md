# Advanced Network Repository

This repository contains several Packet Tracer files (.pkt) related to advanced networking concepts. The Packet Tracer files were created as part of various networking courses and cover topics such as static and dynamic routing, DHCP, NAT, and VLSM.

## Packet Tracer Files

The following Packet Tracer files are included in this repository:

- `1-Fast_Revision_on_CCNA.pkt`: This file provides a fast revision on CCNA concepts, including configuring routers and switches, VLANs, and STP.

- `2-Static_routing.pkt`: This file demonstrates how to configure static routing between multiple networks.

- `3-Configure_RIPv2.pkt`: This file demonstrates how to configure RIPv2 routing protocol on a network.

- `4-Configure_DHCP_RIP.pkt`: This file demonstrates how to configure DHCP and RIPv2 on a network.

- `5-EIGRP_DHCP.pkt`: This file demonstrates how to configure EIGRP routing protocol and DHCP on a network.

- `6-VLSM_ERIGP_.pkt`: This file demonstrates how to configure VLSM and EIGRP routing protocol on a network.

- `7-Static_Dynamic_Nat.pkt`: This file demonstrates how to configure static and dynamic NAT on a network.

- `8-EIGRP_PAT.pkt`: This file demonstrates how to configure EIGRP routing protocol and PAT on a network.

- `MyExam .pkt`: This file is a practice exam for networking concepts.
